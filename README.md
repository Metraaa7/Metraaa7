Hi My name is Yevhenii Shestak
Web Developer
Hello, I'm Karavang, also known as Yevhenii Shestak. I'm a freelance full-stack developer. I have a deep passion for creating digital services and web applications. If you're in search of someone to develop a webservice, a customized website, or a web application, look no further – I'm here to help. When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, you'll likely find me enjoying my love for cycling or exploring the fascinating realm of cars. Currently, I'm navigating the vast landscape of the IT world, actively engaged in the field of web development. If you have a project in mind or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out. I'm enthusiastic about turning your digital concepts into reality.
